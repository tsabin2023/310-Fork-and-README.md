# CNE330 Fork and README.md Project

CNE310HWwithCNE330file.py solves the following problem below by determining if the fourth octec input is a 0, odds, or evens and outputing the appropriate response. 

Your router assigns even IP addresses to Windows machines, and odd IP addresses to Linux machines.
Write a function, ip_to_operating_system that takes the last octet of an IP address (0-255) and returns “Linux” or
“Windows” If a user enters 0, report “Router”
Note: user input request has not been coded because it was not part of the assignment.
