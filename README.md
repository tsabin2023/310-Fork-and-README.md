# CNE330 Fork and README.md Project

CNE310HWwithCNE330file.py solves the following problem below by determining if the fourth octec input is a 0, odds, or evens and outputing the appropriate response. 

Your router assigns even IP addresses to Windows machines, and odd IP addresses to Linux machines.
Write a function, ip_to_operating_system that takes the last octet of an IP address (0-255) and returns “Linux” or
“Windows” If a user enters 0, report “Router”
Note: user input request has not been coded because it was not part of the assignment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will run the code on your local machine for solving the following problem. 

Your router assigns even IP addresses to Windows machines, and odd IP addresses to Linux machines.
Write a function, ip_to_operating_system that takes the last octet of an IP address (0-255) and returns “Linux” or
“Windows” If a user enters 0, report “Router”.
Note: user input request has not been coded because it was not part of the assignment.

### Prerequisites

This project requires [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and an external [python script](https://github.com/tsabin2023/CNE310_Tyler/blob/main/CNE310HWwithCNE330file.py).

## Running
Once installed you can run the program with the following steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the python script is downloaded in (most likely in your Downloads directory).
3. Assuming the script is in your Downloads directory (if not skip to #4), enter the following commands:
```
cd Downloads
python CNE310HWwithCNE330file.py
```

4. After navigating to where the script is located in enter the following command: 
```
python CNE310HWwithCNE330file.py
```

Expected output after executing the script:
```
Windows
Windows
Linux
Windows
Linux
```
